    "> List Comprehension is a way of creating a list by running an expression on each item in a sequence. The code written consists of one line instead of instansitating a new list object and then looping through it seperatly and appending values. The syntax consists of brackets containing an expression, which is executed for each element along with a loop to iterate over each element."

    "> 1. **Expression**: a member of an object, a call to a method, or any other valid expression that returns a value\n",
    "> 2. **Variable**: represents a member of an input sequence \n",
    "> 3. **Input Sequence**: an object (list, set, function, string, etc) that can return its elements one at a time\n",
